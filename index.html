			<p>Hi! I'm Willie, a current aspiring Software Engineer within the Thinkful program from Baltimore, MD. </p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I joined the program looking to upskill and continue my journey into my huge career change! Being a current Cloud Computing graduate, as well as a current Educator, I don't neccesarily have to traditional technology background to break into the industry. Utilizing the program will allow me to learn extensive skillsets that will aid in progressing my abilities that I will be able to bring to any company.</p>

      <p>Outside of my goal of completing my career change, I like to enjoy my other free time doing fun activities. The fun activities include watching sporting events, regularly going to the gym, and daily fun with the family! </p>
