	       <h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hi! I'm Willie, a current aspiring Software Engineer within the Thinkful program from Baltimore, MD. </p>
			
			<p>I joined the program looking to upskill and continue my journey into my huge career change! Being a current Cloud Computing graduate, as well as a current Educator, I don't neccesarily have to traditional technology background to break into the industry. Utilizing the program will allow me to learn extensive skillsets that will aid in progressing my abilities that I will be able to bring to any company.</p>

      <p>Outside of my goal of completing my career change, I like to enjoy my other free time doing fun activities. The fun activities include:</p>
  <ul>
<li>Watching sporting events</li>
<li>Regularly going to the gym</li>
<li>Daily fun with the family</li>
  </ul>
